<title>for Ken and Angela Ofori-Atta</title>

<text>If light were affliction
If the dark were cash
If one could be weighed against the other and traded
If bales of light were delivered by boat from across the loch and parcelled out
Once a week, say; we would hear the engine
And though we liked and enjoyed the darkness
We would still be queuing up, clutching coin.
