<text>Branches don't merge
And rivers don't branch
Although rails can do both
But not cross - that's
Paths and swords, stars,
Maybe bones.
Bones and their off-the-peg, second-hand selves.
They're sowing zizania, darnel and vetch,
Having rare tares in the wheat: don't stare:
It tears, it twains the double turn-gree of the pump
They share, the sinuous, twin spine, though note -
They've neither impish tails nor that stale
Ology which tames the staid and timid
Who strained but never strayed,
God's chosen that trades good for upgrade
Trays of pink champagne in sleeping cars
On trains that travel lines of ice and brittle traves
Where trails can run cold as tales with no teller
And there is no grain to go against.</text>
