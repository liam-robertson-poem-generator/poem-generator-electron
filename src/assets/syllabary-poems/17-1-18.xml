<text>Monkshood, eh? Well you can keep your cowl
And give me an Argive helmet, with the head in,
Flayed and mogrified to larkspur spikes.
Lycoctonon, we'll call him, winter wolfsbane.
A totem pole of him and all his troupe,
A tower of docking stations for the bees,
Catspaw the wise old monkey used
To pull his chestnuts out the purple coals.</text>
