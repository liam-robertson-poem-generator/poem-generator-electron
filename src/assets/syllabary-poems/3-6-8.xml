<title>Aristotle's Syllabary  (for Alasdair MacIntyre)</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>'Let the syllables in a word be substances,
and elements of them - those of substances.
Each should be one in number, and a certain particular thing
And each is seen as the very thing itself.
The same for things the syllables are made of:
There will not, therefore, be more than one letter A, etc…'
The Philosopher deals a difficult hand at scrabble
An internet of fridge-magnet things,
No common coin for science, not the faintest
sonar ping; no rule to pin the future on -
Which doesn't make it wrong
Or right.
