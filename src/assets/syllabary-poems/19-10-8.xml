<title>Deuce</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Beat your brother while he's drunk,
Said Time to himself and the corky nipples
Of his sister-in-law that rendered
Wine not milk. He wondered at
Capillaries that sucked on crusty
Nodules in the substrate, gnats
Without a warning when his brother
Banjoed him back.
