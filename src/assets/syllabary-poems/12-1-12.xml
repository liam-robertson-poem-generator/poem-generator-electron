<title>Health and Safety at Work</title>

<text>Jute's not for threading needles;
Lances, maybe, in jousts:
Two bobbins like a fireman's hose (no knots or kinking)
Where one knight jouks and diddles death
In that quilted dobbin-on-dobbin situation.
What the deuce!
A king can make a belted knight,
But can he make him stick to apple juice?
They really should affix elastic ropes
Plus airbags fit to mitigate
An epidemic of defective bungees.</text>
