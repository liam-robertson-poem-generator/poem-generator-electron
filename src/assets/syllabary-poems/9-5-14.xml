<title>The Chinese Cemetery in Manila</title>

<text>She doesn’t mind. I know
Because you move into somebody’s
Crypt - if they don’t like it, they
Move into your head and you don’t like it:
You’re back to sleep in the street, for that way
When you sleep you sleep. But then
How d’you get clean clothes for going to work?
Sure I work. And cook and clean up, watch TV.
I think she likes it. Not TV. She likes us here
Since she’s still getting used to being dead.
And that takes time. Some take a long time.
But the government’s in a hurry
With their new dead paying money: 
They’d take her out for trash. So it’s
Move over Mrs, make a little room
We have to shelter from the monsoon.
We’re not the Meiguo people mama
To dump you down the smoky hill,
Satellite dish on that nice roof,
Children going to school. Yes I told her
We’d keep her safe from you.
