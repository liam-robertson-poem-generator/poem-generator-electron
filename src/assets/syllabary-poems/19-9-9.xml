<title>Putem zerna</title>
<author>Vladislav Khodasevich</author>
<text>The sower walks across the furrowed field
Where father and grandfather both have toiled.
The grain of wheat is golden in his hand,
But it must fall into the black, black ground.
And it shall, where the blind worm makes its road,
At the allotted hour, die and grow.
And my soul too will go the way of the grain:
Down in the dark to die, and live again.
And you, my country, and you, its folk,
Will die and live again. The year is dark
And the only wisdom, our only sign:
The living all must go the way of the grain.</text>
