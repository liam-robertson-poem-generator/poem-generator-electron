<text>Trams to clang and sparkle stars
That fizzle in sudden tarns.
Alighting passengers consider
Tines, the tangs or horns - toot, toot!- 
Of this one: do they jump
Or miss their stop?
Someone caulks and tars
The coachwork, port and starboard,
Touches up the passengers'
Paleface tans. A trans
Conductor keeping tabs
On tickets. Their inspector
Tags along.
