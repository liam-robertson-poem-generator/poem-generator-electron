<text>The toads are in their heaven - one snug
In a gardening shoe. The Filipina's toes
Trigger a shriek. Two flip through the cat door
Conjoined. One meditates in a bandolier of worms;
Tomes of exegesis bud in its jewelled head
Too soon, too complex for its warty neurons.
Ah me, the bell tolls. Its rope tows
An apprentice ringer off his feet, to wonder
What troves of rhyme await us under grass that can't distinguish
The tones of the cow bell from the chant of the cow.</text>
