<title>Cradle, part 4</title>

<text>Take my hand, give me your hand.
The mammoths fell the trees, we learn to stand.
Our fingers find, caress, command.
The hominid brain develops, and my bones
brace to contain impatient you. Just mind
the apes that rode the styptic sea
on a raft of African rainwood. Continents
and crustal plates of your skull
drift into place around them. There,
the pelvic bones unclasp, the floor gives way.
