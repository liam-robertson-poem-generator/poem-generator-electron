<title>Gled</title>
<author>Aleksandr Blok</author>
<text>Circling, ring on even ring
Above the drowsy huts it hovers
And watches the deserted green.
A cottage hearth; a harrowed mother
Says  - eat your bread, son, take the breast,
Grow big, be good, take up your cross.
The years go by, the wars go on,
Rebellions flare, and burn the burghs.
You never change, my ancient land,
In all your beauty, in all your sorrow.
How long should the mother mourn?
How long will the black kite turn?</text>
