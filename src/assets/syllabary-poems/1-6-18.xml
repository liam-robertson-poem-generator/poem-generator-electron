<text>The last lady gone, her man is ill - what though
He owns the city. Proof of which
He lays him down on the random pavement.
Plain-clothes social security men around him so discrete
They don't know who it is or that they're guarding.
Booze companies spend billions to attract and keep his custom;
The wealthy want assurances, he won't return their calls
For he is her man.</text>
