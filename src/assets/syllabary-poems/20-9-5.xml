<text>The prison door is always open
And the sign above it says
You can leave if you want.
Go on, poke your head out, leave.
There you are in another regime
Under different circumstances;
Likely enough there too thereâ€™ll be
A sign above the door that says
You can leave if you want -
But maybe not.
