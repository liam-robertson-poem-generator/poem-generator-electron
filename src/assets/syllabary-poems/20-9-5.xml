<text>The prison door is always open
And the sign above it says
You can leave if you want.
Go on, poke your head out, leave.
There you are in another r&#233;gime
Under different circumstances;
Likely enough there too there’ll be
A sign above the door that says
You can leave if you want – 
But maybe not.
