<text>'If play were enjoyed for its own sake,
we would play always, which is inappropriate.â€™
Aquinas, Summa Contra Gentiles, 3.25
Games have rules, toys don't. The toy
Is sovereign. It translates from troy to metric
Then you bin it.
Toy town roundabout, first out the gate -
Your clinkered cuddy, joiner still inside it,
Drilling air holes. Where's the script?
