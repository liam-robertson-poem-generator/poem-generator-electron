<text>'If play were enjoyed for its own sake,'
we would play always, which is inappropriate.’
Aquinas, Summa Contra Gentiles, 3.25
Games have rules, toys don't. The toy
Is sovereign. It translates from troy to metric
Then you bin it.
Toy town roundabout, first out the gate –
Your clinkered cuddy, joiner still inside it,
Drilling air holes. Where's the script?
