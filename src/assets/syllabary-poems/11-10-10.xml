<title>Cowboys and Carolingians</title>

<text>What's grim to getting scythed when the grain is good?
The big man neither sighed nor signed a contract, but that priest
Was seen to. The whole thing was out to tender.
The boss got into his stride and sired
A pack of sons, who put in bids.
One delights in the hunt, another's
Mammy styled him princeling, next one
Can't decide what side he's on. He throws the dice.
The grim sniper, maybe that's it:
A wee snide snick and the cord gets severed.
Spotter sized them up with pre-war Zeiss binoculars
The knucklebones roll and slide and stop.
The marksman winked and smiled.
