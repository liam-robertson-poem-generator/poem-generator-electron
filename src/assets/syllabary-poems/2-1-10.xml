<text>A thousand flowers bloomed
The jade-toothed chairman boomed
Some suckers booed and that was that,
No bud but bowed to the chairman's
Flocks that browsed, that ruminate still
And brood on his one-liners, brewed as tinctures.
How they boozed! Prisoners, with luck
Were bound and bruised. At best
That was what happened.
