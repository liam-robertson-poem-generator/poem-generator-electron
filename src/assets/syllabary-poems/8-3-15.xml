<text>Deirdre,
We got your postcard. Only you
Would send us a daguerreotype of San Zeno
From NYC. It's raining here. It rains,
It does rain. Here, just like in Glasgow (Scotland),
Verona and New York. That's neither here
Nor there. It isn't raining in the postcard,
Nor on it, where magenta clouds are held
At bay as the Romanesque confabulation
Explains itself in yellowing black on white,
So there's no drop nor damp to fox the coloured
Oil Mantegna cut when he intoned
The 4-dimensional triptych on the alter.
4-PART MOTET REFASHIONS TIME AND SPACE
was the headline in La Suisse that day. Today:
ORGANES HUMAINS: UN MONSTRUEUX TRAFIC
NOS PAGES OFFRES D'EMPLOI. I should apply:
A dealer in hearts, a vendor of spleen more often.
Enough of that. The Gaberlunzie Man
- allow the lateral jump, I'll get to the point - 
was James V touring Edinburgh incognito;
I fancy that in Scotland every day
There's a 5'72 space the rain runs rings round
But doesn't touch, the burl and build of me;
It's stencilled next to a tenement,
At a closemouth looking in, or on a roof,
Extended on the sphagnum, combing the machair
With all the other exiled presences,
God's gaberlunzies. Got the picture? Right,
So far so long, Manhattan Harmattan.
