<title>Home</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>It could be in Islamabad or Rome
Or the house we got in Switerland,
For home, like poems of mine read out
By people I won't know,  isn't even
Some place I remember. It's
Wherever you bed down, alone or with me,
Demanding 'sustainable cuddles' like a good wee
Bureaucrat, warming your soles against my shins.
A boat hove to, as if we could make
A port of any storm, though one we won't,
There'll yet be room beside me. Yours.
