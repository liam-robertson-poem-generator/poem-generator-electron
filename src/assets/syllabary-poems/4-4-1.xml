<text>My  body clock
Six hours out.
Five minutes’ sleep
And there you were.
From
The palace of congress
A whaleback piazza
Downtown
The casbah was awash. We found
A teashop, colour of canvas,
Drank espresso at the counter;
That was it.
I don’t see
A word between us,
Words about us, yes
There were:
Ah, the inseparables!
Which we’re not
Or is the bee
In his little heart
Never anywhere else
Never anywhere but
In the nodding moment
That picked him out.
