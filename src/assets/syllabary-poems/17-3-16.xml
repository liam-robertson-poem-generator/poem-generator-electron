<text>The first wheel (you can bet) 
Was clog-shod; circular
Tictactoe. The first manned flight
Was feather-fledged, and flapped.
Machines don't need that skeuomorphic stuff.
Recycle tyre-treads as flip-flops: 
No skin off their nose. Baptize yourself
A cog in the wealth condenser; 
Language too is otiose. Sabotage?
Sabotage, though. They find that problematic.
