<text>'Alito's speech was delivered at a conference on religious liberty in Rome hosted by the University of Notre Dame law school.' - The Guardian, 29 July 2022.
'Alito, breath, as in alito cattivo, halitosis;
'My way' Frank Si- Notre; Dame as in 'there ainâ€™t nothin like'.
He was there to gloat, a tic of power not justice.
He'll deliver a speech, but not the clinical
Orphans bless-me-fathered under him.
