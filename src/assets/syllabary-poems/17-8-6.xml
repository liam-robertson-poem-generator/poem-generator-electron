<text>Sic grace and mercy nane can craif
Bot thay that troublit hartis haif.
Luther wrote off Purgatory
As the biggest scam in Europe;
Oligarchs binned their upgrades,
Reclaimed the real estate.
You'd to deal with God direct
And if you didn't win, you lost.
Kirks were stripped to structure.
The anxiety could kill
And did. Though God
Would recognize his own,
He wasn't aware of death
Or didn't see it as a problem
Till Jesus died. Till Bach
Took up the ballads, the psalms,
The Ugaritic hymns to Baal they drew on
And magnified their grace.
I come in eirth, and their did dwell,
I send na message bot my sell.
