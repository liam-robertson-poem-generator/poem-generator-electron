<title>Remember, Coot, that thou art Paint</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Couched in such terms we were
Crouched and thumb-printed with smoke
Ash and suet, forehead some touch-screen
To the priest, who can't write or own
Even his sack-cloth and cabbage-leaf cloot.
His vows were ugly and a bit too cute.
Does this count? Towards what?
The golem fear was cowped; cooped-up
Want was taken raw and cooked.
