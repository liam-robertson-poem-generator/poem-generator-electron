<title>Eels Boiled in Brew</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Lord Randall, quoth his true-love,
Coating her hands in flour,
Du must dein Leben ändern;
Picking the eels out one by one,
Cutting throat and spine with scissors.
You whit?
It's Rilke: You must change your life.
Rilke, is it? And what's for tea?
