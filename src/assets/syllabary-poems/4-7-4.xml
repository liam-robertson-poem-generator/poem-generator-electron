<title>Kickshaws in mem. John Crombie</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>The moustache said 'I'm grumpy' (which he was)
Though the grey eyes couldn't hide dismay, amusement or delight.
He set up shop in Charit√©, among funereal florists,
His printed books - the petals on a lead chrysanthemum;
Slept in the back shop - something out of Whitmarsh - God knows how.
Retreated to his pill-box flat in noisy Montparnasse.
Last time he ventured out on his own, just him and his stick,
A plastic bag for a bottle of J&B,
A beggar at the bottle shop harassed a man on crutches;
John tried to intervene; the codgers landed in a heap,
More Metamorphosis than his old pal Sam. Which made him laugh.
