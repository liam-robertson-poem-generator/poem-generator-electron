<text>It'll say what you like
But not sigh. That's you, sofa,
Spry with the formal weight of Mrs P
For Papadopoulos, the spy,
It says. You see her scry
Nothing much. The sky is blue
I bet. Now there's one you could psych out
Sly for a slice you sny like a snake
And it shows, in your eye, a sty.</text>
