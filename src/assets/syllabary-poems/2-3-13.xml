<text>Bleach is whiten or black,
Botch is wreck or repair.
Broaches breach or bedeck;
They can make a barque wallow -
Not birch bark. Some beechmast, maybe,
In a hot bright purple borsch,
Me the butcher adding this batch of words,
Batch as in 'bacio', a kiss; it's from baking and brewing.
And a blotch of smetana on top.
