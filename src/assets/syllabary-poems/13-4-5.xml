<title>That </title>

<text>Oh y canny shove yr granny aff a bus.
Ach yr granny (that canny
Be shoved aff a bus) is a cowboy.
As is the granny that can. To be clear:
Canny means gauny no dae that or else?
And how many grannies have you seen eject
From the deck of a Leyland Atlantean, eh?
And how many grandweans in juvenile courts
Hauled up for skipping their fare
And the ticket in grandmama's pocket?
