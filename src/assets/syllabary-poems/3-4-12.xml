<text>It's hard to regard an amputation as a plus.
Jade pus and gas gangrene. Starfish putts, or rather
Punts the ball with his pirate crutch for a croquet mallet.
Then it's the hockey: pucks and peevers sizzle across the ice.
As he plucks the hair of victory from a nostril of defeat
To puffs of applause from punks with mongrel pups  and junkshop prams
The strain pumps cramp in the pulps of his calves; he starts to cry.
A fan plumps up his pillow, checks his forehead with her lips,
Rocks the pram some more and takes his pulse. He takes her purse
And hops it.</text>
